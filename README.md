## Introduction

The **House Price Analyzer** is a Python-based project that leverages data analysis, visualization, and machine learning to provide insights into house price trends. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling to help users understand the factors influencing house prices and make accurate predictions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess raw housing data to prepare it for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and explore the data to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features and transform existing ones to improve model performance.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict house prices.
- **Model Interpretability**: Understand the importance of different features in predicting house prices.
- **Visualization**: Generate insightful visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

## Installation

To get started with the House Price Analyzer, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/visxnu/HousePriceAnalyzer.git
   cd HousePriceAnalyzer
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. **Open the notebook** `HousePriceAnalyzer.ipynb` to start exploring the project.

## Usage

The project is organized into several sections, each corresponding to a step in the data analysis and modeling process:

1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset into the notebook.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize distributions, correlations, and trends in the data.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features and select the most relevant ones for modeling.
5. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤.
7. **Model Interpretability**: Use techniques like SHAP values to interpret model predictions.
8. **Visualization**: Generate plots and charts to communicate insights.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is included in the `data/` directory. It contains various features related to houses, such as:

- **Square Footage**: Size of the house.
- **Number of Bedrooms/Bathrooms**: Number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
- **Location**: Geographic location of the house.
- **Year Built**: The year the house was built.
- **Price**: The target variable, representing the house price.

You can replace this dataset with your own housing data by placing it in the `data/` directory and updating the data loading code in the notebook.

## Modeling

The project includes several machine learning models for predicting house prices:

- **Linear Regression**: A simple baseline model.
- **Random Forest**: A robust ensemble method.
- **Gradient Boosting**: A powerful technique for regression tasks.

Each model is trained and evaluated using cross-validation to ensure reliable performance.

## Results

The results of the analysis and modeling are presented in the notebook, including:

- **Model Performance Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤ scores for each model.
- **Feature Importance**: Insights into which features are most influential in predicting house prices.
- **Visualizations**: Plots showing actual vs. predicted prices, residual analysis, and more.
